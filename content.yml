      description: 'I started by making simple websites with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript when I was 13 years old. During my masters study I picked up coding and at Mobiel.nl, I learned how to code professionally: readable, reliable (tested) and concise. I got introduced to many working principles, such as Test Driven Development, Mobile First and Rest APIs.'
