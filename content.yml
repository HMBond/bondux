      description: I am used to think along with the designers as a developer. I did graphic and UX design for modernizing a back-office and a new air traffic control game. On the side, I'm designing a <a href="https://mmc.mrsunshine.live">multiplayer midi controller</a> for artists to give the audience predefined control over their (live) music. Allowing artists to create interactive audio games. Next to that I like to tinker and solder on hardware projects, such as writing open-source firmware for <a href="https://patsaudio.com">Pats</a>.
