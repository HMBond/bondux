      description: 'I started by making simple websites with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript when I was 13 years old. During my masters study I picked up coding and at Mobiel.nl, I learned how to code professionally: readable, reliable (tested) and concise. I got introduced to many working principles, such as Test Driven Development, Mobile First and Rest APIs.'

      description: I have a masters degree in Design For Interaction (TU-Delft) and I am used to think along with the designers as a developer. I did some graphic and UX design for modernizing a back-office and a new air traffic control game. On the side, I'm designing a modular midi controller (<a href="https://mmc.mrsunshine.live">MMC3000</a>) to bridge the gap between audience and performer and develop an interactive platform for creating musical games.
